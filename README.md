# Ray-Casting
Certainly, here's a README file for your Raycasting project on GitHub:

Raycasting is a simple raycasting simulation implemented in Python using the Pygame library. It generates a 2D environment with walls and demonstrates the concept of raycasting, a technique often used in computer graphics and game development.

## Overview

Raycasting is a technique used to simulate a 3D effect in a 2D environment by casting rays from a point (e.g., the player's viewpoint) and calculating what those rays intersect with. This project demonstrates a basic raycasting implementation in a 2D environment.

## Key Features

- Simulated 2D Environment: The project creates a 2D environment with walls that are used to cast rays.
- Raycasting: It implements raycasting by casting rays from a player's point of view and calculating intersections with walls.
- Visualization: The simulation provides a visual representation of how rays interact with the environment.
- Dynamic Environment: Walls are generated randomly, allowing for different scenes in each run.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python and the Pygame library installed on your system.

3. **Run the Simulation**: Execute the `raycasting.py` script.

```bash
python raycasting.py
```

4. **Interact with the Simulation**: The simulation will display a 2D environment with walls. You can move the mouse cursor around to see how rays are cast from the player's point of view and interact with the walls.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the simulation, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3
- Pygame library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/raycasting.git
cd raycasting
```

2. Install the required dependencies, especially the Pygame library:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## How it Works

Raycasting works by casting rays from a central point (representing the player's view) and checking for intersections with walls. The simulation calculates the closest wall intersection for each ray, providing a visual representation of how rays interact with the environment.
